        <h1>Development Environment</h1>
        <p>First, let's talk about the <b>Command Line</b>. The command line will help you get to the workspace for your code in VS Code.</p>

        <h2>Command Line</h2>
        <p>Go to the folder where you have your project saved. Then right click and click the option of "Git Bash Here".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is an example of the folder I'm using</li>
            <img src="folder.PNG" width="500px"/>
            <li>Then here is my gitbash to help me make sure I'm in the right project folder to start coding!</li>
            <img src="gitbash.PNG" width="500px"/>
        </ul>

        <p>Below are some descriptions of what the abreviations mean in my command line:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>cd</i> is used to call up directories. </li>
            <li><i>ls</i> is used to list the contents of a directory -- it displays the other folders and files.</li>
            <li><i>pwd</i> means present working directory and is used to see what directory (file) you are currently in.</li>
            <li><i>code .</i> allows you to open this directory in VS code -- Make sure you have this command downloaded in your VS Code before you try and do this command on the Command Line.</li>
        </ul>
